The software for the Latero device is divided into libraries and programs. The latero-graphics library (this project) is used to create tactile renders for the Latero device. The latero-graphics library links to the latero library, and therefore, the latero library must have been installed first.

This release of the sofware has been tested on  Mac OS X Maverick and Yosemite. Please follow these instructions. If you've successfully built and run this software on another platform, please list the steps you followed below.

MAC OS X
*********

Step 0: Make sure the latero library is installed
--------------------------------------------------
See instructions in INSTALL file for latero project.

Step 1: Install the latero-graphics library
--------------------------------------------
-- Correct search path so .pkg files are found (By default, pkg files installed by users are not part of the search path).
>> export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/
This needs to be done for each terminal that you start (as an alternative, you can add that line to the .profile file)

-- Build and install the library
You can use cmake to generate Xcode projects.
>> cmake . -G Xcode
>> xcodebuild -target laterographics
>> sudo xcodebuild -target install

If the installation is successful, the library liblaterographics.a will now be in /usr/local/lib/ and the include files in /usr/local/include/latero-graphics/

You can run the program latero-demo (another project) to test the latero graphics library.

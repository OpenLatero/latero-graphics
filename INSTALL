The software for the Latero device is divided into libraries and programs. The latero-graphics library (this project) is used to create tactile renders for the Latero device. The latero-graphics library links to the latero library, and therefore, the latero library must have been installed first.

This release of the sofware has been tested on  Mac OS X Maverick and Yosemite. Please follow these instructions. If you've successfully built and run this software on another platform, please list the steps you followed below.

MAC OS X
*********

Step 1: Make sure the latero library is installed
--------------------------------------------------
See instructions in INSTALL file for latero project.

Step 2: Install dependencies
-----------------------------
Most of the necessary dependencies can be installed using MacPorts. In order to enable SVG support in Gdk::Pixbuf, the "librsvg" package must installed.
>> port install ImageMagick gtkmm libxmlxx3 librsvg

Step 3: Download, build and install the audiere library (optional)
------------------------------------------------------------------
The audiere library is used to support audio and is not required for most users of the latero-graphics library. Since this library is rather old and difficult to install, it is recommended to skip this step.

There is no port for the audiere library.
-- Download audiere (Unix Source Release 1.9.4): http://audiere.sourceforge.net/download.php
-- Add the following line in the file audiere-1.9.4/src/utility.h:   #include <stdlib.h>
   Without it, you won't be able to build audiere.
>> ./configure
>> make
>> sudo make install

Step 4: Install the latero-graphics library
--------------------------------------------
-- Build and install the library
You can use cmake to generate Xcode projects.
>> cmake . -G Xcode
>> xcodebuild -target laterographics
>> sudo xcodebuild -target install

If the installation is successful, the library liblaterographics.a will now be in /usr/local/lib/ and the include files in /usr/local/include/latero-graphics/

You can run the program latero-demo (another project) to test the latero graphics library.



Cygwin

--------------------------------------------------
See instructions in INSTALL file for latero project.

Step 2: Install the latero-graphics library
--------------------------------------------
-- Build and install the library
>> cmake .
>> make
>> make install

If the installation is successful, the library liblaterographics.a will now be in /usr/local/lib/ and the include files in /usr/local/include/latero-graphics/

You can run the program latero-demo (another project) to test the latero graphics library.
